# UFO

## Overview of Project:
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis filters through UFO related data from January 1, 2010 to January 13, 2010. From this data, a webapp has been developed to allow a user to easily enter search criteria to filter through the data. From this data, the user will be able to see potential evidence of UFO activity.

## Results:
### Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

This application is available at: https://waciciarelli.github.io/UFO/

Opening the page, the user is greeted with styled web page and a paragraph of information on UFO's. To start their own search, a user simply needs to scroll down.

To start, the user will see the unfiltered data from the ufo dataset:
![Unfiltered Data](https://github.com/waciciarelli/UFO/blob/main/static/images/unfiltered%20data.png?raw=true)

In order to filter this data, the user simply needs to type a date, city, state, country, and/or shape into the respective boxes and press enter. The data will the be filtered to match the criteria described by the user:

## Summary:
### In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One main issue I see with this design is that it relies too heavily on user input. To further explain, having the user type in so many filters is prone to error. As such I would suggest changing the country and shape inputs to being drop down menus to reduce this chance for error.

One other suggestion I would make to improve this site, would be to change the section of results to have its own scroll bar or pages to circulate through. This would make the site look much better visually for long query results.
